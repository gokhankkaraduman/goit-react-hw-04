## Project Description

Inspirography is a React application that allows users to search for images using keywords. It leverages the Unsplash API to fetch and display relevant images based on user queries. Users can browse the image gallery and view detailed information about each image in a modal window.

This project is built with **Vite** for a fast development experience and utilizes **React** for dynamic UI rendering and state management.
